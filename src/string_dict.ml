(* In order to be efficient, we make assumption about the runtime representation of
   strings. Essentially we assume that it's OK to see a string as a flat array of words
   and that padding bytes are never random.

   Since this is probably not portable in Javascript, the primitive that make these
   assumptions are written in C, where the value representation is documented. Moreover,
   the OCaml compiler is not yet able to generate code that is as efficient as C for the
   [find] function.

   4.04 introduces [Sys.backend_type], so if we can get the OCaml implementation as
   efficient, we can switch back to an OCaml implementation.
